Free Code Camp zipline in Angular with MDL

Really basic stuff. I'd like to have the random page be able to reload so you could try again if it wasn't random enough for you,
and also I'd like a way back for users from the actual wiki page if they decide to click on a card - displaying it inside the ifram instead of a separate page should work.
Also maybe instead of the canned 'No image available' for pages without a main image, there could be a flickr search with the search term as keyword..
